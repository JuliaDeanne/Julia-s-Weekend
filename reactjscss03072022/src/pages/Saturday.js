    <p class="card-text">High Grounds Cafe is a 24 hour coffee shop / restaurant situated off Tomas Morato in Quezon City that 
        offers various  coffee-based drinks, cakes and comfort food. What makes it special is their high-end 
        PC gaming services thats available for rent to anyone who wants to play. I orderd Mac and Cheese and triple chocolate drink to enjoy the evening</p>
